# Bank Loan Report Dashboard (SQL + Power BI)

**Interactive loan performance dashboard built using SQL Server and Power BI to help banks analyze key loan metrics and trends.**

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

As an aspiring Data Analyst, I developed a dynamic **Bank Loan Report Dashboard** to visualize loan performance data and support business decisions. This project involved data cleaning, KPI modeling, and interactive dashboard design to highlight loan trends by geography, grade, and purpose.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Banks face challenges in tracking and analyzing large volumes of loan data. Key questions addressed include:

- What proportion of loans are performing versus non-performing?
- What are the month-to-date (MTD) and month-over-month (MoM) growth trends in applications, funded amounts, and repayments?
- How do loan metrics vary across states, grades, and purposes?

## ‚öôÔ∏è Approach

1. Imported and cleaned raw loan data (38,000+ records) in **SQL Server**.
2. Created complex SQL queries to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs), including total loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, interest rates, debt-to-income ratios, and classification of good vs bad loans.
3. Built a dedicated **date table** in Power BI to enable advanced time intelligence functions like MTD and MoM growth.
4. Connected the cleaned and modeled data to Power BI for visualization.
5. Designed three dashboards:
    - **Summary:** KPI cards with dynamic slicers for states, grades, and purposes.
    - **Overview:** Trend analysis with interactive visuals and toggleable metrics using field parameters.
    - **Details:** Tabular view of granular loan data with export options for deeper analysis.
6. Validated all dashboard metrics by cross-checking with SQL query results to ensure accuracy and reliability.
7. Used DAX measures and Power Query transformations to enhance performance and user experience.

## üìà Results & Impact

- Enabled stakeholders to drill down by loan grade, state, purpose, and employee length.
- Provided instant switching between different KPIs (applications, funded amounts, repayments).
- Highlighted areas with high concentrations of non-performing loans to inform risk mitigation strategies.
- Identified seasonal trends in loan repayments and approvals to support operational planning.
